# Boundless Foundry Template

This template serves as a starting point for developing an application with verifiable compute provided by [Boundless][boundless-homepage].
It is built around a simple smart contract, `EvenNumber`, and its associated RISC Zero guest, `is-even`.

## Build

To build the example run:

```bash
# Populate the `./lib` submodule dependencies
git submodule update --init --recursive
forge build
cargo build
```

## Test

Test the Solidity smart contracts with:

```bash
forge test -vvv
```

Test the Rust code including the guest with:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Deploy the contract on Ethereum Sepolia

First, export the following env variables:

```bash
export RPC_URL="https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com"
export WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

To deploy the `EvenNumber` contract run:

```bash
forge script contracts/scripts/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url ${RPC_URL:?} --broadcast -vv
```

Save the `EvenNumber` contract address to an env variable:

<!-- TODO: Update me -->
```bash
# First contract deployed and top of logs is EvenNumber
export EVEN_NUMBER_ADDRESS=#COPY EVEN NUMBER ADDRESS FROM DEPLOY LOGS
```

> You can also use the following command to set the contract address if you have [`jq`][jq] installed:
>
> ```bash
> export EVEN_NUMBER_ADDRESS=$(jq -re '.transactions[] | select(.contractName == "EvenNumber") | .contractAddress' ./broadcast/Deploy.s.sol/11155111/run-latest.json)
> ```

## Run the example on Ethereum Sepolia

First, export the following env variables, pointing to the deployed contracts on Sepolia:

> You can find the latest deployment information at [docs.beboundless.xyz/deployments](https://docs.beboundless.xyz/deployments)

```bash
export BOUNDLESS_MARKET_ADDRESS="0x01e4130C977b39aaa28A744b8D3dEB23a5297654"
export VERIFIER_ROUTER_ADDRESS="0x925d8331ddc0a1F0d96E68CF073DFE1d92b69187"
export SET_VERIFIER_ADDRESS="0xea6a0Ca4BfD0A6C43081D57672b3B6D43B69265F"
```

The example app uses the [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) IPFS pinning service to host the zkVM guest ELF binaries, and for inputs.
You can sign up with their free tier, which will have plenty of quota to get started.
You can also send inputs directly in your transaction, and can host your guest on any public HTTP service.

```bash
export PINATA_JWT="YOUR_PINATA_JWT"
```

To run the example run:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin app -- --even-number-address ${EVEN_NUMBER_ADDRESS:?} --number 4
```
